# Slides (source files) for [Large Scale Convex Optimization via Monotone Operator](https://large-scale-book.mathopt.com/)
Authors: [Ernest K. Ryu](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~ernestryu/) and [Wotao Yin](https://wotaoyin.mathopt.com/)

We are sharing our LaTeX Beamer source files made for the book [Large Scale Convex Optimization via Monotone Operator](https://large-scale-book.mathopt.com/). There is a .tex file for each chapter in a seperate folder. They rely on the shared .tex files under *preambles/*.

You can also directly access the same set of files from [this overleaf repo](https://www.overleaf.com/read/tsrbtmrxkcqr). A benefit of overleaf is that it generates the final PDF files.
