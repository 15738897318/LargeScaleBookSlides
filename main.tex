\begin{frame}{About the book}

\begin{witemize}
    \item It presents a unified analysis of many  convex optimization algorithms through the abstraction of monotone operators
    \item The approach allows us to efficiently derive and analyze a large number of optimization algorithms with a streamlined analysis
    \item It is meant for both mathematicians (with elegant abstractions and challenging exercises) and engineers (with technical simplicity and utilities).
\end{witemize}
    
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{About the slides}
  Our goal is to provide a useful resource for students and researchers who want to self-study the book and for instructors who want to incorporate the book into their courses.
  \bigskip
  
  The source files of the slides for all chapters (once completed) are available for download.
